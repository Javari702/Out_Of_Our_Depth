üéÆ Project Overview                                                                                                
Out of Our Depth is a puzzle‚Äìplatformer inspired by the classic childhood game Fireboy and Watergirl. Players must navigate our character "Rockboy" through obstacle-filled levels by solving environment-driven puzzles and coordinating movement. The game emphasizes timing, critical thinking, and trial-and-error problem solving.

As the Lead Programmer, I was responsible for designing the core gameplay systems, implementing character control logic, and integrating game objects and obstacle mechanics. I collaborated closely with the artist to align visual design with gameplay requirements and with the secondary programmer to maintain clean, modular code.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Contributions                                                                                                                                            
During development, I designed and implemented the following core systems:                                                              

Character Controller Logic (C# scripting)                                                                                      
Interaction System (usable objects, puzzle triggers, environment sound effects)                                                        
Some Level Layout & Progression Flow (Final Level in Particular)                                                                
Enumerations for Multiple Game Objects                                                       
Delegates & Observer Pattern for event-based actions                                                                
Singleton Pattern for centralized audio management                                                

This project has strengthened my ability to:    

Write readable, and modular gameplay code                                                          
Coordinate gameplay logic between multiple designers/programmers                                              
Debug efficiently in a fast-paced development window                                                          

üïπÔ∏è Some Tips When Playing! 

You can interact with the tall grass to teleport by using 'E'                                                                           
Restart the level by using 'R'
